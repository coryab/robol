# ROBOL

This is an assignment from the Programming Languages (IN3040) course at UiO.

## Documentation

All the information can be found in the docs generated by sphinx.

I recommend looking at the doc generated in ```docs/build/html```, as it looks the best.

you can also view the documentation [here](https://coryab.github.io/robol/build/html/index.html).
