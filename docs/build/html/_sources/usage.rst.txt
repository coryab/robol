Requirements
------------
- Python 3.10.X

Running the tests
-----------------
Running the tests is very simple. There are 4 test programs that can be run, so you can choose to run them individually by specifying a number 1-4 as the argument, or you can choose to run them all, by specifying "all" as the argument.

Here is an example of how you would run all tests:

.. code-block::
    
        python tests.py all

Running the interpreter
-----------------------
If you want to test out the interpreter as a whole, you can absolutely do that!
There are some test programs in the **robol_programs** directory that have the .robol extension.

Here is an example of how to run the interpreter with a .robol file:

.. code-block::
    
        ./robol robol_programs/loopyloop.robol

All the robol programs from the assignment are also there if you want to test them.
